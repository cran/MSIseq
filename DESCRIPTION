Title: Assess Tumor Microsatellite Instability with a Decision Tree
        Classifier from Exome Somatic Mutations
Type: Package
Author: Mini Huang
Description: A decision tree classifier for detecting microsatellite instability (MSI) in somatic mutation data from whole exome sequencing. MSI is detected based on different mutation rates in all sites as well as in simple sequence repeats. This mechanism can also be applied to sequence data of targeted gene panels with shorter sequence length.
